# Teaching Philosophy

I believe music has the power to shape lives far beyond the notes on the page.  
It is a discipline that engages both sides of the brain—developing coordination, memory, creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking.

The simultaneous use of the left hand and right hand in string playing, for example, activates both hemispheres of the brain and fosters powerful neurological connections that support learning in all areas of life.

I have had the privilege of teaching students as young as four and as old as seventy, and I deeply believe that there is no age limit to learning when there is passion and curiosity.

My role as an educator is not only to teach technique and musical understanding, but to guide students in how to:

- Practice with intention  
- Express themselves authentically  
- Grow as confident individuals

More than anything, I want to be a life mentor, not just a teacher who instructs one note after another.

I strive to inspire my students to find meaning, discipline, and joy through music—lessons that resonate well beyond the classroom or the stage.
