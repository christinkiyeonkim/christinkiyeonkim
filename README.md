# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Christin Kiyeon Kim

I'm a professional cellist and dedicated music educator based in Chicago  
and currently transitioning into a career in IT, focusing on automation, Python, Jira, and SQL.

With years of experience performing and teaching, I bring a disciplined, detail-oriented approach to every project.  
I'm now applying that same mindset to technology, building skills in system automation, data handling, and project organization.
