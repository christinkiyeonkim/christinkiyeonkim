# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Christin Kiyeon Kim

I'm a professional cellist and dedicated music educator based in Chicago.  
With experience performing and teaching across a wide range of settingsâ€”from solo stages to chamber music and classroomsâ€”I aim to bring joy, discipline, and personal growth through music.

This repository is a collection of my musical background and educational philosophy.
